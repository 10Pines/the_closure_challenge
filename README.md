The Closure Challenge
=====================

The goal is to implement the :build_return_block_from method defined in closure_challenge_spec.rb so all tests pass.

Seems easy... why don't you give closures a try?

Rules
=====

You can only use the Ruby core library.
The only gem you can use, if you need to, is Binding of Caller.
Your solution should run on MRI and JRuby.

Good luck!
