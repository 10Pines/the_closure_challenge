The Closure Challenge
=====================

The goal is to implement the :build_return_block_from method defined in closure_challenge_spec.rb so all tests pass.

Seems easy... why don't you give closures a try?

Rules
=====

* Only use the Ruby core library.
* No monkeypatchin' :)
* The only gem you can use, if you need to, is Binding of Caller.
* Solution should run on MRI and JRuby.

Good luck!
